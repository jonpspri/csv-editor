```
Title: CSV Editor: Give AI assistants powerful CSV data manipulation via MCP

I built CSV Editor, an MCP server that gives Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants powerful CSV processing capabilities.

üîß Features:
- Read/write CSV, Excel, Parquet files
- Advanced filtering and transformations
- Data validation and quality checks
- Statistical analysis and outlier detection
- Seamless AI integration via Model Context Protocol

üì¶ Installation:
pip install git+https://github.com/santoshray02/csv-editor.git

The tool bridges the gap between AI assistants and data manipulation, making complex CSV operations as simple as natural language commands.

Would love feedback from the community!

GitHub: https://github.com/santoshray02/csv-editor
```

### Hacker News Template
```
Title: Show HN: CSV Editor ‚Äì AI-powered CSV processing via Model Context Protocol

CSV Editor is an MCP server that enables AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT to perform sophisticated CSV data operations through natural language commands.

Key innovations:
- Uses Model Context Protocol for seamless AI integration
- Pandas-powered backend for performance
- Comprehensive data validation and analysis
- Support for multiple file formats

The project solves the problem of AI assistants being limited in data manipulation tasks. Instead of asking users to write Python scripts, they can now directly process CSV files through conversation.

Built with FastMCP framework and includes full test coverage, documentation, and examples.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete GitHub release** (highest priority)
2. **Submit to 2-3 Reddit communities** this week
3. **Write Dev.to article** about MCP development
4. **Engage with early users** and gather feedback
5. **Iterate based on community response**

Remember: Quality engagement over quantity. Focus on providing value to each community!
